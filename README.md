## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nandini and I'm a first year Computer Science & Software Engineering (CSSE) student at the University of Washington. I'm particularly drawn to CSSE because of how innovative the field is and how it prioritizes building solutions to real world problems. I'm most interested in Machine Learning and AI, as well as full stack app development. 

I primarily use Java, Javascript, Python, and HTML/CSS. I have also recently started exploring frontend development tools such as React and Figma. 

Additionally, I'm involved in many Computer Science related college associations dedicated to making CS a more inclusive space that aims to educate and support students. On the side, I enjoy tinkering with UI/UX to see how apps can look more visually pleasing. 

This summer I have been accepted to Break Through Tech at Cornell University's Sprinternship program where I will be tackling a "challenge project" in a team.
